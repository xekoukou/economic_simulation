We have the problem of finding which tools are required for research.

Somw guiding rules are:

* Tools required might be build from a different knowledge production path.

A  laser might be required to build a processor but building the laser requires different knowledge.

* Research always has a specific goal.

Till now we have defined the interelations of knowledge.
We have simplified the process by saying that when we improve or specialize one knowledge, only that knowledge is required to do that.

A more accurate research process would include more abstract knowledge as contributory factors to research.

That abstract knowledge would certainly be in the dependency path of the knowledge we research. 
Thus if we are to simplify our process, we can assune that all the knowledge from which this knowledge derives is known to the researchers. 

The problem that arises is that previous abstract knowledges could have improved till this knowledge was researched. This improvement can increase the probability of this research succeeding. That improvement though cannot be assumed to be known to the researchers because it might be known only by specific people and/or firms.

* Knowledge is a property of a person or a firm.

We have seen that when we improve one technology that was based on to make products, the new technology allows us to produce products of similar but better characteristics, (cheaper production process / increased desirability//fulfilment). We have idenitified the production process with the tool itself since it is the new tool that allows the new production process.

For tools that are used for research though, we have an additional complexity. When we improve one knowledge, can we use the same tool to improve it again. It seems natural to say that yes, we can use it again for the improved knowledge.


* A tool used for research on a specific knowledge can be used for all the improved knowledges as well.


We have pointed that a research tool originates from different knowledge paths than the one it is used on. The problem though is that we need 
to know the knowledge it can be used so that we can understand its usefullness in that area.

The same thing can be said about the usefulness of a product. 

----------------------------

We build consumer products, production tools, research tools.

We need to split research into multiple processes.

* We improve the knowledge of a specific field.
* We specialize into a specific field.
* We generalize results from a specific field.
* We understand what the new technology allows us to build.
Thus for each new tool, we do not have knowledge of the products that we can create with it. Its usefulness needs to be found.

It can be used in multiple production processes.

The main problem is how to define the probability of finding multiple tools that can produce a single commodity.
we can define certain properties that those equations must uphold.

* Each compination of tools have a different probability that doesn't depend on the probabilities of other compinations.
This means that this specific set of tools determines the possibility of compination and nothing more.

* The number of tools in the compination should play no role in the probability of this compination. (the tools are randomly selected unlike reality that are selected based on usefulness.).
The difficulty should be a multiplication of the specialization probability but whether that probability exists depends on the physical characteristics of the research itself. We need to define a distribution that generates those possibilities.

* Any entity that has more tools should have more probability of reaching to a usefull compionation.

* The level of specialization of the technology of a tool should diminish the probability for any compination it belongs.

-------------------------------------------------------------

* The number of tools in the compination should play a role in the probability of this compination.
The difficulty should be a multiplication of the specialization probability but whether that probability exists depends on the physical characteristics of the research itself. We need to define a distribution that generates those possibilities. The distribution should be independent on the number of tools.

* The results of a research should be known a bit before research within a deviation function.

Example:

Let us say that we have researched a technology. We should know the tools we can produce with this new technology.

Manufacturing tools and research tools. A new technology can enable previous manufacturing tools to build this tool.

The manufacturing tools will be derived from the same knowledge path that the research tools was derived.
Thus one would say that the tools used for research could be used to also do the manufactoring if we improve the technology that produces them.


example:

We have learned a specific knowledge with the use of specific research tools. We learned to build new tools that will be manufactured when we specialize/improve the technology of the tools we used in research. The new tools allow new products to be created. They allow possibly new compinations between technologies. If those tools are research tools that are to be used in specialization, we learn of the possible consumer product produced by those future tools. We need a distribution of uncertainty on the future knowledge.


---------------------------

Improved tools can have a different production process.

They need though to build a product that is superior or they are cheaper to build or the new production process is cheaper.
